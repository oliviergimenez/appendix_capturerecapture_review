# A review of the past decade of capture-recapture 

This repository contains the appendix, data and codes for a paper submitted to be submitted to (Frontiers in) Ecology and Evolution on reviewing the past decade of research in capture-recapture. 

The appendix `recap_analyses.html.zip` is a zipped html file: download the zip file, unzip it and open the file with your favorite internet browser (e.g. Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer). 

The `R` code to reproduce this appendix is in `recap_analyses.Rmd`; you will need the `data` and `figs` folders to run it, just download or clone the repo.
